Something I threw together to output colours from a Photoshop .aco file to a JSON file. Useful if you have a brand colour swatch and need easy access to the hex codes.

INSTALLATION
	gcc -O2 -Wall -W -o aco2json aco2json.c

USAGE

  cat example.aco | ./aco2json > /path/to/converted.json

The program reads from standard input the ACO file
and outputs to standard output the generated HTML file.
